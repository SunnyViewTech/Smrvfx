**Smrvfx** is a Unity sample project that shows how to use the
[skinned mesh sampling feature] with VFX Graph to emit particles from animating
characters.

About this repository
---------------------

Previously, this repository contained a custom package called *Smrvfx* that
implemented a mesh sampling feature as VFX Graph didn't provide the feature at
the time.

The built-in skinned mesh sampling feature was implemented in HDRP 11.0, so I
changed the main aim of this repository to provide an example of the built-in
feature.
